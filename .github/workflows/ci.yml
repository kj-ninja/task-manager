# Interview Question #87: Branch strategies and deployment workflows
# This workflow demonstrates modern CI/CD practices for frontend applications:
# - Comprehensive code quality gates
# - Performance-focused caching strategies
# - Security-conscious dependency management
# - Clear separation of concerns between different check types
